# Getting started

To use codriver you need access to a **large language model (LLM)
provider** — a cloud service like OpenAI or Anthropic, a model running
on your own machine, or a proxy provided by your organisation. Codriver
supports a wide range of providers by building on the [ellmer
package](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org). This article explains how to
connect codriver to your provider. It assumes you already have access to
one — meaning you have signed up, obtained an API key, or been given
credentials by your organisation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

If you have an **API key set and know your provider**, this is all you
need:

``` r

# OpenAI
codriver::codriver_configure("openai", model = "gpt-5.1")

# Anthropic Claude
codriver::codriver_configure("anthropic", model = "claude-sonnet-4-5")

# OpenAI-compatible endpoint
codriver::codriver_configure("openai_compatible",
  base_url = "https://llmproxy.example.com/v1",
  model    = "gpt-4.1"
)
```

Any provider and argument supported by
[ellmer](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org) works. Read on if you need help
with authentication, model selection, or provider-specific notes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Providers

Codriver does not communicate with LLM providers directly. Instead, it
relies on [**ellmer**](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org), a package that
provides a unified interface to a wide range of providers. Ellmer
supports many popular services — OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google
Gemini, Mistral, Ollama, and more — and handles the details of
authentication and communication for each one.

When you call
[`codriver::codriver_configure()`](https://vdwulp.github.io/codriver/reference/codriver_configure.md),
you tell codriver which provider to use by passing its **name** — a
short string like `"openai"` or `"anthropic"`. Any argument accepted by
the corresponding ellmer constructors can be passed directly through
[`codriver_configure()`](https://vdwulp.github.io/codriver/reference/codriver_configure.md).

| Provider          | `name`                | Environment variable   |
|-------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| OpenAI            | `"openai"`            | `OPENAI_API_KEY`       |
| Anthropic         | `"anthropic"`         | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`    |
| Google Gemini     | `"google_gemini"`     | `GEMINI_API_KEY`       |
| Azure OpenAI      | `"azure_openai"`      | `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| AWS Bedrock       | `"aws_bedrock"`       | *(IAM credentials)*    |
| Databricks        | `"databricks"`        | `DATABRICKS_TOKEN`     |
| Snowflake         | `"snowflake"`         | `SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN`      |
| Groq              | `"groq"`              | `GROQ_API_KEY`         |
| Mistral           | `"mistral"`           | `MISTRAL_API_KEY`      |
| Perplexity        | `"perplexity"`        | `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`   |
| OpenRouter        | `"openrouter"`        | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`   |
| Ollama (local)    | `"ollama"`            | *(none required)*      |
| LM Studio (local) | `"lmstudio"`          | *(none required)*      |
| OpenAI-compatible | `"openai_compatible"` | `OPENAI_API_KEY`       |

> *The table covers providers commonly used. Ellmer supports additional
> providers - see the [ellmer
> homepage](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/index.html#providers) for the
> full and current list.*

Most providers require a **model** to be specified, but ellmer will
select a default for most providers. If a default is used, ellmer will
print it to the console on every codriver call. Specifying the model
explicitly in
[`codriver_configure()`](https://vdwulp.github.io/codriver/reference/codriver_configure.md)
avoids this. See \[Model discovery\] below if you are unsure which
models are available on your endpoint.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Authenticating

Before codriver can send requests to an LLM, it needs to prove to the
provider that you are authorised to use it. How this works depends on
the provider.

The most common approach is an **API key**: a secret string that you
obtain from your provider’s website and store on your machine. Ellmer
looks for these keys in **environment variables** — named slots in your
R session that hold configuration values. Each provider expects its key
in a specific variable.

The table above lists the environment variable names of commonly used
providers. If your provider is not in the table or uses a different
authentication mechanism, look at the help page for the corresponding
ellmer constructor. For example, running
[`?ellmer::chat_openai`](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/chat_openai.html)
in R will tell you that OpenAI expects `OPENAI_API_KEY` and
[`?ellmer::chat_aws_bedrock`](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/chat_aws_bedrock.html)
tells you about their specific authentication mechanism.

The recommended way to set an environment variable permanently is to add
it to your `.Renviron` file, which R reads automatically at startup. The
example below shows how this is done.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## OpenAI

OpenAI is the provider codriver has been most thoroughly tested with.
GPT-4.1 and GPT-5.1 both produce clean, reliable completions in the
RStudio workflow codriver is designed for.

To get started, go to
[platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com), sign in, and create
an API key under **API keys**.

Then store it in your `.Renviron`:

``` r

file.edit("~/.Renviron")
```

Add:

    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

Save the file, restart R and then configure codriver:

``` r

codriver::codriver_configure("openai", model = "gpt-5.1")
```

That is all that is needed. You’re now ready to [start using
codriver](https://vdwulp.github.io/codriver/articles/start-using-codriver.md)
in your RStudio workflow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## OpenAI-compatible endpoint

Many organisations run their own LLM infrastructure that speaks the
OpenAI API format. This includes local model servers, research clusters,
and company proxies. For these, use `"openai_compatible"` as the
provider name.

Unlike named providers, an OpenAI-compatible endpoint has no defaults.
You will need to know the **base URL** and **model name** from your
organisation’s documentation or administrator.

By default, `"openai_compatible"` reads the API key from the environment
variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`. If you want to keep it separate from an
actual OpenAI key, save a different key under a custom environment
variable name and pass it explicitly:

``` r

codriver::codriver_configure(
  "openai_compatible",
  base_url    = "https://llmproxy.example.com/v1",
  model       = "gpt-5.1",
  credentials = function() Sys.getenv("CUSTOM_API_KEY")
)
```

> *Note: older ellmer documentation may show an `api_key` argument -
> this is deprecated in favour of `credentials` in combination with an
> environment variable, which avoids hardcoding keys in your code.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Provider notes

Some notes on experience with providers:

- **OpenAI** is the provider codriver has been most thoroughly tested
  with. GPT-4.1 and GPT-5.1 both produce clean, reliable completions in
  the RStudio workflow codriver is designed for.

- **Anthropic Claude** models have also been tested quite extensively.
  Especially Claude Sonnet 4.5 has been confirmed to work well with
  codriver.

- **Google Gemini** produces good results too. When using *free tier* be
  aware that some models are *very slow* and only allow for a few
  requests per day. Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite has been proven to be quick
  and works well with codriver.

  The Gemini Flash 2.5 (non-lite) series models use an internal
  reasoning process that can occasionally cause thought text to appear
  in completions. If you encounter this, try passing `api_args` to
  suppress thought output in the response:

  ``` r

  codriver::codriver_configure(
    "google_gemini",
    model    = "gemini-2.5-flash",
    api_args = list(
      generationConfig = list(
        thinkingConfig = list(includeThoughts = FALSE)
      )
    )
  )
  ```
