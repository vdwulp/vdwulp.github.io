# Free API access

*You can use codriver without paying for an API subscription!*

Codriver requires API access to an LLM provider, but isn’t tied to a
particular provider or subscription. There are several free options
available: **free API access** with a cloud provider, or setting up your
own local server. This article covers some available options that are
free to start with, and some considerations of each.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Google Gemini

Google offers free API access to Gemini models through [Google AI
Studio](https://aistudio.google.com). Sign in with a Google account,
create an API key, and store it in your `.Renviron`:

``` r

file.edit("~/.Renviron")
```

Add:

    GOOGLE_API_KEY=*your_key_here*

Save the file, *restart RStudio* and then configure codriver:

``` r

codriver::codriver_configure("google_gemini", model = "gemini-3.5-flash-lite")
```

At the time of writing **Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite** or **Gemini 3.5 Flash
Lite** are the recommended model for codriver on the free tier. These
models offers 500 requests per day each (max. 15 per minute) and respond
reasonably quick. Other Gemini models on the free tier are either
heavily rate-limited or slow enough to make interactive use impractical.

> To check current free tier limits, go to [Google AI
> Studio](https://aistudio.google.com) \> *Usage & billing* \> *Rate
> limits*. Sort by *Category* to find *text-out models*.

On the free tier, Google may use your prompts to improve their models.
Review [Google’s API terms](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms)
before use.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Mistral

Mistral AI, a French company, offers a free tier through
[console.mistral.ai](https://console.mistral.ai). Sign up, create an API
key, and store it in your `.Renviron`:

``` r

file.edit("~/.Renviron")
```

Add:

    MISTRAL_API_KEY=*your_key_here*

Save the file, *restart RStudio* and then configure codriver:

``` r

codriver::codriver_configure("mistral", model = "mistral-medium-latest")
```

At the time of writing, **Mistral Medium Latest** is the recommended
model for codriver on the free tier, but you may run into rate limits.
Start with `mistral-medium-latest`, and if you run into rate limits,
switch to the highest-numbered `mistral-medium-*` version available in
the model list:

``` r

# Get available models and filter on `mistral-medium-*`
ellmer::models_mistral() |>
  dplyr::filter(startsWith(name, "mistral-medium-"))

# Look up highest-numbered `name` and replace `2508` below
codriver::codriver_configure("mistral", model = "mistral-medium-2508")
```

The free tier of Mistral comes with the same caveat as Google Gemini:
your prompts may be used for model training. That said, Mistral is a
European company subject to EU law, which may be relevant for data
governance considerations. Check [Mistral’s terms of
service](https://mistral.ai/terms) for the current policy.

## Local model server

For maximum privacy, run a model locally. [Ollama](https://ollama.com)
and [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) both provide local model servers
that codriver can connect to. No API key required, and nothing leaves
your machine.

The trade-off is speed and model capability. Local models are generally
slower and less capable than cloud models, especially on machines
without a dedicated GPU. For lightweight tasks like completing a short
line of code they can work well; for more complex generation or editing,
results may be less reliable.

##### Ollama

After installing and pulling a model, e.g. `ollama pull codellama`,
configure codriver:

``` r

codriver::codriver_configure("ollama", model = "codellama")
```

##### LM Studio

Start your local server in the [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) app,
then configure codriver:

``` r

codriver::codriver_configure("lmstudio", model = "your-loaded-model")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Other options

The free tier landscape changes quickly. A few other providers worth
knowing about:

- **[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)**

  A gateway to many models from different providers, some of which are
  free. One API key gives access to a wide range of models. Use
  `"openrouter"` as the provider name in codriver.

- **[Groq](https://console.groq.com)**

  Fast inference on open models like Llama and Mixtral. Free tier
  available. Use `"groq"` as the provider name in codriver.
