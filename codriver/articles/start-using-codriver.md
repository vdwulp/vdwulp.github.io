# Using codriver

Once you have configured a provider, codriver is the context-aware AI
assistant for RStudio that is literally at your fingertips. Codriver is
by your side to work in-place on the code you are editing.

*If you haven’t configured yet, read the article [Getting started with
codriver](https://vdwulp.github.io/codriver/articles/getting-started-with-codriver.md).*

Codriver works directly in the RStudio source editor. During
configuration, codriver offers to register the default keyboard shortcut
**`Ctrl+/`**. Shortcut registration is strongly recommended, but can be
skipped or changed later via **Tools \> Modify Keyboard Shortcuts** in
RStudio.

Pressing the keyboard shortcut - or invoking from the **Addins** menu -
launches codriver. Codriver inspects the editor context, chooses and
executes one of five modes, and presents the result.

This article explains the codriver modes and how results are presented.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Codriver modes

Codriver determines the mode from your cursor position and any
selection. At a high level:

- **At end of code → complete**  
  Codriver will complete the line of code at the cursor position.

- **On a comment line → generate**  
  Codriver will use the comment as a natural language instruction to
  generate new code.

- **In whitespace → continue**  
  Codriver will generate a new line or block of code without
  instruction, from context only.  
  *Note: whitespace directly after a comment line will trigger generate
  mode instead.*

- **In code → edit**  
  Codriver will suggest improvements or fixes to existing code.

- **In an inline comment → comment**  
  Codriver will suggest a short inline comment (or improvement) for the
  code on the same line.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Result presentation

Depending on the context and selected mode, results are presented as
**ghost text** or an **edit suggestion**.

**Ghost text** - shown gray and italic in the editor - is used when
codriver suggests new content at the cursor position with nothing to
replace. Accept with `TAB`. Moving the cursor, clicking with the mouse,
or typing anything other than the suggested characters dismisses the
suggestion.

**Edit suggestions** with green and red highlighting are used when
codriver proposes changes to existing code. Green for added text, red
for removed text. If the suggestion contains only additions, only
removals, or a single addition paired with a single removal on the same
line, the changes are shown inline in the existing code, with a marker
in the gutter. Accept with `TAB` or by clicking the gutter marker.
`Escape` dismisses the suggestion.

For more complex changes, a small panel appears just below the affected
code instead. Accept with `TAB` or by clicking **Apply**. `Escape` or
clicking **Discard** dismisses the suggestion.

When codriver has no meaningful suggestion, it shows ghost text “# no
suggestion” or an edit suggestion panel with no changes highlighted.
